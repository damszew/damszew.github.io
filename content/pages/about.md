I’m a **Rust developer** _(and proud of it!)_ with several years of experience - though I got my start wrangling **C++** for a couple of years before I saw the light.
I’m hooked on backend development, especially when it comes to building fast, reliable systems for the cloud and web.

Over the years I've worked on a range of projects:

- **Embedded Linux devices** - low-level, hands-on systems work
- **High-throughput, low-latency microservices** - powering complex enterprise backends
- **Small monolithic backends** - collaborating directly with clients to shape and deliver custom solutions

When I’m not coding, you’ll probably find me:

- At the **gym** or on the **tennis court**
- **Tending my lawn** like a suburban dad
- **Tinkering** with code and exploring programming languages just for fun
- Keeping up with the latest **tech news** and, yes, the _occasional_ **programming drama**

This blog is where I share some of my thoughts, experiments, and opinions _(whether anyone asked for them or not)_.
