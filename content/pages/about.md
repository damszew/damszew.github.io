Experienced Rust Developer with a strong background in C++ and an interest in drones.

I'm a software developer with a background in C++, though these days my focus is entirely on Rust.
I've worked on a range of projects, from building backend systems to developing real-time data streaming solutions,
with experience spanning embedded systems in telecom to large-scale monitoring systems for critical infrastructure.

In my free time, I’m always experimenting - whether it's coding pet projects to explore concepts
or diving into new programming challenges just for fun.
I love pushing the boundaries of what’s possible with tech
and often share my thoughts on software development through my blog.

Oh, and I like to hit the gym too!
